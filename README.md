Color-picking thing
Emily Stuckey, 10/3/21

App shows a screen with red (horizontal) and blue (vertical) values going from 0 to 255 in increments of 16. Clicking on a block will reveal the RGB values of that block. 
Long-clicking will increase green value in that block by 16. User can also use up and down arrows in toolbar to increase or decrease green values for the entire screen by 32.
